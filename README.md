# Cluedle

üîó https://cluedle.app

A [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/) hint tool.

Cluedle is a "reverse" Wordle of sorts. Upon selecting one or more letters, up to 200 solutions are presented. Users can then click on a highlighted letter in a solution to indicate that it should appear in that exact spot, filtering the results even more.

1. Select one or more letters to see possible solutions.
    * Tap a letter to *INCLUDE* it.
    * Tap it twice to *EXCLUDE* it.
    * A third tap will *RESET* it.
2. Click a matching letter in the word list to indicate *EXACT* placement.

## Installation ‚öõÔ∏è

After downloading this repository:

1. Ensure that you have an appropriate package manager installed on your system such as `npm` (ships with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)) or `yarn`.
2. In your terminal of choice, navigate to the folder where the code resides and run `npm ci` to pull down the required dependencies. This only needs to be done whenever a new version of **package.json** or **package-lock.json** is pulled down.
3. Start the application by running `npm run dev`.

## Acknowledgements üëã

I created this project as way of practicing my React skills. I had just completed an introductory course and wanted to build a self-assigned project. (Side note, I highly recommend the [Learn React Today](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/learn-react-today) course for anyone that is new to React). I also studied some of the conventions found in Devang Thakkar's [Wordle Archive](https://github.com/devangthakkar/wordle_archive), which helped a lot.

As such, you may come across one or more antipatterns as I delved into the idea of custom hooks on my own. I would gladly welcome any constructive feedback!

And finally, the most obvious inspiration for this project is the official [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/) game. It should be noted, however, that Cluedle is not affiliated with Wordle or The New York Times Company.
